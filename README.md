# Commodity Inventory System

The objective of this project is to build an inventory system that will enable the organisation using it to manage their stock effectively and efficiently, so as to run the business well.

## Functions for Inventory Management

These functions will help a user to control, optimise, and manage the ordering and storage of data in the inventory :-

1. Management optimisation process: -Optimisation of inventory model for easy access to product info.
2. Filters for searching commodities: -Filtering process to search for particular products based on particular requirements.
3. Adding new commodities with basic information: -Increasing inventory list and adding info for new products.
4. Delete commodity and basic information by user demand: -Delete products which have sales below minimum required sales.
5. Change commodity info when stock changes, price changes, etc: -Change inventory details if details of product change.
6. Automatic change of inventory status according to commodity amount that is currently available: -Inventory status update.
7. Deliver alerts when commodity is out of stock: -Alert system for low/out of stock conditions.
8. Economic suggestions for products using the sales info.
9. Max and min sales: -Calculate quantity of units sold for product and give products with max and min sales.

## Our method for an Optimised Inventory Model

Our optimised inventory model will use the above mentioned functions in conjunction with sorting(Multiple varieties based on Alphabetical order, Quantity remaining, fastest moving etc.) to ensure a user friendly assess to the inventory.

A very clear list of the products is necessary for a comprehensive inventory system. This sort of a clear tabular output will be an important part of our program.For reference: -

To achieve these objectives, we will be making use of structures, linked lists, dynamic variables and a number of libraries and C++ resources.
