# Commodity Inventory System
Inventory model
#
Inventory management for brands to control and manage the ordering and storage of inventory
1. Optimisation of management process.
2. Search commodity according to different filters
3. Insert new commodity with basic information
4. Delete obsolete Commodity
5. Update commodity information
6. Automatic change of inventory status according to amount of commodity that is currently available
7. Deliver alerts when commodity is put of stock
8. Automatic reordering of products which are out of stock or low in stock
9.

## 3-D Representation of the Inventory Concept

As the above figure suggests, the inventory model will be stocking products in terms of x,y and z positions.
### Significance of x
Products of similar category will be under the same value of x (Vegetables in grocery store, Electrical components in automobile manufacturing unit etc.)
### Significance of y
Different Products under the same category will be under the same value of y (Carrots and Potatoes under Vegetables,Transistors and Capacitors under Electrical components etc.)
### Significance of z
Any sub variety under the same Product will appear as different products under z (Australian Carrots and Chinese Carrots under Carrots,10mF and 20mF Capacitors under Capacitors etc.)

## Our method for an Optimised Inventory Model

Our optimised inventory model will use the above mentioned functions in conjunction with sorting(Multiple varieties based on Alphabetical order, Quantity remaining, fastest moving etc.) to ensure a user friendly assess to the inventory.

A very clear list of the products is necessary for a comprehensive inventory system. This sort of a clear tabular output will be an important part of our program.

To achieve these objectives, we will be making use of structures, linked lists, dynamic variables and a number of libraries and C++ resources.
